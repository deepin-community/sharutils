Description: shar, unshar, uuencode, uudecode
 `shar' makes so-called shell archives out of many files, preparing
 them for transmission by electronic mail services.  `unshar' helps
 unpacking shell archives after reception.  Other related utility
 programs help with other tasks.
 .
 `uuencode' prepares a file for transmission over an electronic
 channel which ignores or otherwise mangles the eight bit (high
 order bit) of bytes.  `uudecode' does the converse transformation.
