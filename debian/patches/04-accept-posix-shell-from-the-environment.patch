Subject: libopts.m4: accept POSIX_SHELL from the environment during
 the configure step

This lets us set it to the canonical path /bin/bash, even on systems
where both /bin/bash and /usr/bin/bash are available, and therefore
which(1) might return /usr/bin/bash (depending on PATH order).

Both copies of libopts.m4 are marked as generated files, but the files
from which they were generated do not seem to be present in the sharutils
package. This change is equivalent to part of a 2016 autogen commit
<https://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/autogen.git/commit/?id=db064b9a>.
